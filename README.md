# R-Gallery


  
Welcome to the R Gallery Book, a complete guide to the [R Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/) website. This book is taken directly from R Gallery with careful detail in reproducing plots and completing ideas. This is a collection of plots, graphs, diagrams, etc., using R programming language and was combined into one single reading collection of updated R gallery plots and graphs.

While this book was created to encapsulate the entire [R Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/) website into one readable source, another purpose is serving as introductory level into data visualization using [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html).
