Welcome the R Gallery Book, a complete guide to the [R Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/) website. This book is taken directly from R graph gallery with careful detail in reproducing plots and completing ideas. This is a collection of plots, graphs, diagrams, etc., using R programming language.
