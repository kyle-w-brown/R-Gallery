# Introduction

Welcome the R Gallery Book, a complete guide to the [R Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/) website. This information is taken directly from R graph gallery with careful detail in reproducing plots and completing ideas. This material created by [Kyle W.

While this book was created to encapsulate the entire [R Graph Gallery website](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/) into one readable source, another purpose is serving as introductory level into data visualization using [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html).
